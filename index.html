                My love Anshika, I just want to thank you for everything — for the joy you bring, the laughter we share, and the beautiful memories we create together. But also, thank you for standing with me through the tough times, because even in those moments…

                I want to face them with you, to fight through them and overcome them hand in hand. You are truly so important to me, I love what we share, and I know we can always make it stronger if we both want it — and believe me, I really do.

                I genuinely love you, and I will try with all my heart, until the very end, because I’m not with you out of need or out of convenience — I’m with you because I choose you, every single day.
              </p>

                I love you endlessly, my Anshika ❤️
